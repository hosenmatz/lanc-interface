Other notes:
camera's zoom control - was able to zoom from 18 seconds full range with
light touch to 2 seconds at full press.

I have a different piece of PIC code that let me easily cycle through all
of the possible codes, and about an hour of playing let me figure out
pretty much everything that works on the 900... well, all of the single
byte commands - I didn't go hunting for any possible multi-byte commands or
such.    I found the 8 zoom speeds, and a bunch of other things..   just
transcribed my year old scribble notes so I won't lose them (included
below).   That's another project that is probably worth documenting - since
it would let anyone figure out what _their_ camcorder does fairly easily.
(would probably need a little more development since I used these really
clever TI hex display LED modules - TIL311 I think - that have all the
decoders and latches built in, but they're not easy to find, eat power and
cost about $15 each... would be best to use one of the PIC with the LCD
drivers built in...)

I should probably go back and play a liitle more now that I'm more familiar
with the various little symbols on the LCD panel.   I didn't recognize some
of them right off, so the notes are a little confused....

Oh well, time to give up for the day....
