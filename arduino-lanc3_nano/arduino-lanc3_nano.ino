/*
  Send a Start/Sop command to the LANC port of a video camera.
  Tested with a Sony Hi8XR CCD-TR840E camcorder
  Feel free to use this code in any way you want.

  "LANC" is a registered trademark of SONY.
  CANON calls their LANC compatible port "REMOTE".

  camcorder commands:
  byte 0 - 18hex - 0001 1000

  byte 1
  play 34hex - 0011 0100
  or
  stop 30hex - 0011 0000
